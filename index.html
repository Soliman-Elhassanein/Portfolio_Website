        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Soliman Elhassanein, a passionate Computer Engineering student at Egypt University of Informatics, where I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree. I have a strong interest in technology, particularly in the field of Artificial Intelligence, which drives my academic and personal endeavors.</p>
        
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I graduated from Summits High School and am currently enrolled at Egypt University of Informatics, pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering. I have a cumulative GPA of 3.33/4.0 and have excelled in courses such as Introduction to Computer Programming.</p>

 
        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
        <p>I currently serve as a Programming Junior Teaching Assistant, where I support programming students through tutorials and assignment corrections. Previously, I was a Mathematics Teaching Assistant at Summits International School, where I organized recitations and prepared academic materials for A-Level students.</p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>I am proficient in C and C++ with a focus on embedded systems applications, and have intermediate knowledge in MATLAB, Arduino, and Python. One of my notable projects includes developing a metal-detecting robot, where I utilized SolidWorks, MATLAB, Arduino, and RF modules to create an efficient and functional device.</p>

        <h2>Publications</h2>
        <p>I have co-authored a publication on numerical methods for solving first-order IVPs, demonstrating my research capabilities and interest in mathematical sciences. Additionally, I am an active member of the Competitive Programming Club, continuously honing my problem-solving and coding skills.</p>
        
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
            I have worked on multiple projects throughout my journey in education, including a metal detecting robot, where we used MATLAB, C, and Arduino. The robot was controlled using a joystick.
        
            Additionally, I participated in developing a library management system that automates various functions, such as borrowing and returning books, sending notifications, and getting approval for students to borrow books from their supervisors.
        
            I have also worked on a project to detect liquid levels in a container using Arduino and sensors.
        
            Moreover, I created an NLP project where I classified books according to their difficulty in language, ideas, and context structure.
        </p>
        
        
        <h2>Activities</h2>
        <p>
            I have actively participated in the Egyptian Collegiate Programming Contest (ECPC), a prestigious and highly competitive programming competition. This experience has significantly sharpened my coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and teamwork, as it required intense collaboration and quick thinking under pressure.
        
            Furthermore, I have been deeply involved in volunteer work with the 'Resala' organization, a well-known charity in Egypt. My role primarily focused on managing and organizing clothes donations. This involved sorting, categorizing, and ensuring that the donated items were in good condition before they were distributed. I also played a key role in the logistics of delivering these clothes to underprivileged communities, where I witnessed firsthand the impact of our efforts on improving the lives of those in need. This experience was not only fulfilling but also taught me valuable lessons in organization, empathy, and social responsibility.
        </p>
        

        <h2>Personal Motivation</h2>
        <p>Driven by an early fascination with science, my goal is to innovate and create life-changing solutions that enhance the human condition. I am inspired by transformative technologies like the internet and AI, and I aspire to contribute to such groundbreaking advancements.</p>
